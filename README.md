# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* **Variables** - A variable is a box for a value. Like a box what is inside a variable can change.
	* **Strings** - Strings are a type of value that can be put inside a variable. Any text like your name, address, or phone number can be a string as long as it's enclosed by single '', or  double "" quotes.
	* **Functions (arguments, `return`)** - Functions take some input called arguments and return some output. A function is like a blender in that it accepts some arguments like milk, assorted fruits, and returns a smoothie.
	* **`if` statements** - If statements are a way to make decisions based on some conditions. For example 'if' it is 100 degrees outside you may decide to wear shorts and a T-shirt when you go outside.
	* **Boolean values (`true`, `false`)** - Boolean values help us figure out if something is true or false. You can think of booleans as representing on/true or off/false.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
